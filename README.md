# I'Verb

This is a mobile application, made with React Native, that contains a comprehensive list of English irregular verbs and their corresponding French translations. The repository provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to search and browse the list of verbs.

## Requirements:
```
- Node > 21
```

# Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RantoPenjy/IVerb
```
```bash
cd IVerb
```
```bash
npm install
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the app:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the app. Run the following command to start on _Android_ or _iOS_:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying the App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:
